IE6CountdownLocalisedImage
==========================

Decide which localised version of the
[IE6 Countdown banner](http://www.ie6countdown.com/join-us.aspx) to
display based on IP geolocation

This is a simple PHP function to get the proper localised version of the ie6countdown image

This is based only on user's location. A better approach would be to
use this combined with user's browser language settings. Languages are
based on the most commonly understood/spoken language in each country.
No offense intended if one language was selected over another.

Images can be found at http://www.ie6countdown.com/join-us.aspx

Country codes can be found by using a geolocation service or database
such as http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/
